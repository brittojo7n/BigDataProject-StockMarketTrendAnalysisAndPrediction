# # Project: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction
# 
# ## Stock Market Data From Google Finance
# 
# ### Introduction
# 
#    Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using data provided by Google Finance. By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!
#    
# ### Questions
# 
# In this analysis, I would like to explore the following questions.
# 
# 1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
# 2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
# 3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
# 4. What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
# 4. What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
# 5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
# 6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

# Check if AAPL data is available and display it
if AAPL is not None:

    print(AAPL.head())  # Display the first few rows of the AAPL DataFrame
else:

# %% [markdown]
# Quick note: Using globals() is a sloppy way of setting the DataFrame names, but its simple
# 
# Let's go ahead and play aorund with the AAPL(Apple) Stock DataFrame to get a feel for the data.

# #### Section 2 - Daily Return Analysis
# 

# %% [markdown]
# Now, that we've done some baseline analysis, let's go ahead and dive a little deeper. We're now going to analyze the risk of the stock.
# 
# 
# In order to do so, we need to take a closer look at the daily changes of the stock, and not just its absolute value. Let's go ahead and use pandas to retrieve the daily returns for the APPL stock.
# 

# %%
# We'll use pct_change to find the percent change for each day
AAPL['Daily Return'] = AAPL['Close'].pct_change()

# Lets plot the daily return percentage
AAPL['Daily Return'].plot(figsize=(12,4), legend=True, linestyle='--', marker='o')

# %% [markdown]
# Great, now let's get an overall look at the average daily return using a histogram. By using seaborn to create both a histogram and kde plot on the same figure.

# %%
# only with histogram
AAPL['Daily Return'].hist(bins=100)

# %%
# Note the use of dropna() here, otherwise the NaN values can't be read by seaborn
sns.distplot(AAPL['Daily Return'].dropna(), bins=100, color='magenta')

# %% [markdown]
# Now what if we wanted to analyze the returns of all the stocks in our list? For that, we need to build a DataFrame with all the ['Close'] columns for each of the stocks dataframes.

# %%
closingprice_df = pd.DataFrame()

for stock in tech_list:
    try:
        data = yf.download(stock, start=start, end=end)
        closingprice_df[stock] = data['Close']
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data for {stock}: {e}")


# %%
closingprice_df.head(10)

# %% [markdown]
# Now that we have all the closing prices, let's go ahead and get the daily return for all the stocks, like we did for the APPL stock.

# %%
# make a new tech returns DataFrame
tech_returns = closingprice_df.pct_change()

# %%
tech_returns.head()

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can compare the daily percentage return of two stocks to check how correlated. First let's see a stock compared to itself.
# 
# ##### GOOGL is a Alphabet Inc Class A Stock.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'tech_returns' is a DataFrame that contains stock returns for each stock in 'tech_list'
sns.jointplot(x='GOOGL', y='GOOGL', data=tech_returns, kind='scatter', color='orange')


# %% [markdown]
# So now we can see that if two stocks are perfectly (and positivley) correlated with each other a linear relationship bewteen its daily return values should occur.
# 
# So let's go ahead and compare Google and Amazon the same way.

# %%
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'tech_returns' is a DataFrame containing daily returns for 'GOOGL' and 'AMZN'
sns.jointplot(x='GOOGL', y='AMZN', data=tech_returns, kind='scatter', height=8, color='skyblue')


# %%
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'tech_returns' is a DataFrame containing daily returns for 'GOOGL' and 'AMZN'
sns.jointplot(x='GOOGL', y='AMZN', data=tech_returns, kind='hex', height=8, color='skyblue')

# %%
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'tech_returns' is a DataFrame containing daily returns for 'AAPL' and 'MSFT'
sns.jointplot(x='AAPL', y='MSFT', data=tech_returns, kind='reg', height=8, color='skyblue')


# %% [markdown]
# Intersting, the pearsonr value (officially known as the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient) can give you a sense of how correlated the daily percentage returns are. You can find more information about it at this link:
# 
# Url - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient
# 
# But for a quick intuitive sense, check out the picture below.

# Seaborn and Pandas make it very easy to repeat this comparison analysis for every possible combination of stocks in our technology stock ticker list. We can use sns.pairplot() to automatically create this plot

# %%
# We can simply call pairplot on our DataFrame for an automatic visual analysis of all the comparisons
sns.pairplot(tech_returns.dropna(),size=3)

# %% [markdown]
# Above we can see all the relationships on daily returns between all the stocks. A quick glance shows an interesting correlation between Google and Amazon daily returns. It might be interesting to investigate that individual comaprison. While the simplicity of just calling sns.pairplot() is fantastic we can also use sns.PairGrid() for full control of the figure, including what kind of plots go in the diagonal, the upper triangle, and the lower triangle.
# 
# Below is an example of utilizing the full power of seaborn to achieve this result.

# %%
# Set up the figure by naming it returns_fig, call PairGrid on the DataFrame
returns_fig = sns.PairGrid(tech_returns.dropna())

# Using map_upper we can specify what the upper triangle will look like.
returns_fig.map_upper(plt.scatter,color='purple')

# We can also define the lower triangle in the figure, including the plot type (kde) & the color map (BluePurple)
returns_fig.map_lower(sns.kdeplot,cmap='cool_d')

# Finally we'll define the diagonal as a series of histogram plots of the daily return
returns_fig.map_diag(plt.hist,bins=30)

# %% [markdown]
# We can also analyze the correlation of the closing prices using this exact same technique. Here it is shown, the code repeated from above with the exception of the DataFrame called.

# %%
# Set up the figure by naming it returns_fig, call PairGrid on the DataFrame
returns_fig = sns.PairGrid(closingprice_df.dropna())

# Using map_upper we can specify what the upper triangle will look like.
returns_fig.map_upper(plt.scatter,color='purple')

# We can also define the lower triangle in the figure, including the plot type (kde) & the color map (BluePurple)
returns_fig.map_lower(sns.kdeplot,cmap='cool_d')

# Finally we'll define the diagonal as a series of histogram plots of the daily return
returns_fig.map_diag(plt.hist,bins=30)

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we can also do a correlation plot, to get actual numerical values for the correlation between the stocks' daily return values. By comparing the closing prices, we see an interesting relationship between Google and Amazon stocks.

# %%
# Let's go ahead and use seaborn for a quick heatmap to get correlation for the daily return of the stocks.
sns.heatmap(tech_returns.corr(),annot=True,fmt=".3g",cmap='YlGnBu')

# %%
# Lets check out the correlation between closing prices of stocks
sns.heatmap(closingprice_df.corr(),annot=True,fmt=".3g",cmap='YlGnBu')

# %% [markdown]
# ##### Fantastic! Just like we suspected in our PairPlot we see here numerically and visually that Amazon and Google had the strongest correlation of daily stock return. It's also interesting to see that all the technology comapnies are positively correlated.

# %% [markdown]
# Great! Now that we've done some daily return analysis, let's go ahead and start looking deeper into actual risk analysis.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Risk Analysis

# %% [markdown]
# There are many ways we can quantify risk, one of the most basic ways using the information we've gathered on daily percentage returns is by comparing the expected return with the standard deviation of the daily returns(Risk).

# %%
# Let's start by defining a new DataFrame as a clenaed version of the oriignal tech_returns DataFrame
rets = tech_returns.dropna()

# %%
rets.head()

# %%
# Defining the area for the circles of scatter plot to avoid tiny little points
area = np.pi*20

plt.scatter(rets.mean(),rets.std(),s=area)

# Set the x and y limits of the plot (optional, remove this if you don't see anything in your plot)
plt.xlim([-0.0025,0.0025])
plt.ylim([0.001,0.025])

#Set the plot axis titles
plt.xlabel('Expected returns')
plt.ylabel('Risk')

# Label the scatter plots, for more info on how this is done, chekc out the link below
# http://matplotlib.org/users/annotations_guide.html
for label, x, y in zip(rets.columns, rets.mean(), rets.std()):
    plt.annotate(
        label,
        xy = (x, y), xytext = (50, 50),
        textcoords = 'offset points', ha = 'right', va = 'bottom',
        arrowprops = dict(arrowstyle = 'fancy', connectionstyle = 'arc3,rad=-0.3'))

# %% [markdown]
# By looking at the scatter plot we can say these stocks have lower risk and positive expected returns.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Value at Risk

# %% [markdown]
# Let's go ahead and define a value at risk parameter for our stocks. We can treat value at risk as the amount of money we could expect to lose (aka putting at risk) for a given confidence interval. There's several methods we can use for estimating a value at risk. Let's go ahead and see some of them in action.
# 
# #### Value at risk using the "bootstrap" method
# For this method we will calculate the empirical quantiles from a histogram of daily returns. For more information on quantiles, check out this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile
# 
# Let's go ahead and repeat the daily returns histogram for Apple stock.

# %%
# Note the use of dropna() here, otherwise the NaN values can't be read by seaborn
sns.distplot(AAPL['Daily Return'].dropna(),bins=100,color='purple')

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can use quantile to get the risk value for the stock.

# %%
# The 0.05 empirical quantile of daily returns

# For APPL stocks
rets["AAPL"].quantile(0.05)

# %% [markdown]
# The 0.05 empirical quantile of daily returns is at -0.016. That means that with 95% confidence, our worst daily loss will not exceed 1.6%. If we have a 1 million dollar investment, our one-day 5% VaR is 0.016 * 1,000,000 = $16,000.

# %%
# For AMZN stocks
rets["AMZN"].quantile(0.05)

# %%
# For GOOGL stocks
rets["GOOGL"].quantile(0.05)

# %%
# For MSFT stocks
rets["MSFT"].quantile(0.05)

# %% [markdown]
# #### Value at Risk using the Monte Carlo method
# Using the Monte Carlo to run many trials with random market conditions, then we'll calculate portfolio losses for each trial. After this, we'll use the aggregation of all these simulations to establish how risky the stock is.
# 
# Let's start with a brief explanation of what we're going to do:
# 
# We will use the geometric Brownian motion (GBM), which is technically known as a Markov process. This means that the stock price follows a random walk and is consistent with (at the very least) the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH): past price information is already incorporated and the next price movement is "conditionally independent" of past price movements.
# 
# This means that the past information on the price of a stock is independent of where the stock price will be in the future, basically meaning, you can't perfectly predict the future solely based on the previous price of a stock.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# Now we see that the change in the stock price is the current stock price multiplied by two terms. The first term is known as "drift", which is the average daily return multiplied by the change of time. The second term is known as "shock", for each time period the stock will "drift" and then experience a "shock" which will randomly push the stock price up or down. By simulating this series of steps of drift and shock thousands of times, we can begin to do a simulation of where we might expect the stock price to be.
# 
# For more info on the Monte Carlo method for stocks and simulating stock prices with GBM model ie. geometric Brownian motion (GBM).
# 
# check out the following link: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/montecarlo.asp

# %% [markdown]
# To demonstrate a basic Monte Carlo method, we will start with just a few simulations. First we'll define the variables we'll be using in the Google stock DataFrame GOOGL
# 

# %%
rets.head()

# %%
# Set up our time horizon
days = 365

# Now our delta
dt = 1/days

# Now let's grab our mu (drift) from the expected return data we got for GOOGL
mu = rets.mean()['GOOGL']

# Now let's grab the volatility of the stock from the std() of the average return for GOOGL
sigma = rets.std()['GOOGL']

# %% [markdown]
# Next, we will create a function that takes in the starting price and number of days, and uses the sigma and mu we already calculated form our daily returns.

# %%
def stock_monte_carlo(start_price,days,mu,sigma):
    ''' This function takes in starting stock price, days of simulation,mu,sigma, and returns simulated price array'''

    # Define a price array
    price = np.zeros(days)
    price[0] = start_price

    # Schok and Drift
    shock = np.zeros(days)
    drift = np.zeros(days)

    # Run price array for number of days
    for x in range(1,days):

        # Calculate Schock
        shock[x] = np.random.normal(loc=mu * dt, scale=sigma * np.sqrt(dt))
        # Calculate Drift
        drift[x] = mu * dt
        # Calculate Price
        price[x] = price[x-1] + (price[x-1] * (drift[x] + shock[x]))

    return price

# ### Value at risk using the "Bootstrap" method
# 
# we will calculate the empirical quantiles from a histogram of daily returns.

# %% [markdown]
# Let's go ahead and use pandas to retrieve the daily returns for the JNJ, WMT & NKE stock.

# %%
# We'll use pct_change to find the percent change for each day

#For JNJ stocks
JNJ['Daily Return'] = JNJ['Close'].pct_change()

# %%
# Note the use of dropna() here, otherwise the NaN values can't be read by seaborn
sns.distplot(JNJ['Daily Return'].dropna(), bins=100, color='r')

# %%
(JNJ['Daily Return'].dropna()).quantile(0.05)

# %% [markdown]
# The 0.05 empirical quantile of JNJ stock daily returns is at -0.010. That means that with 95% confidence, our worst daily loss will not exceed 1%. If we have a 1 million dollar investment, our one-day 5% VaR is 0.010 * 1,000,000 = $10,000.

# %%
# For WMT stocks
WMT['Daily Return'] = WMT['Close'].pct_change()

# %%
sns.distplot(WMT['Daily Return'].dropna(), bins=100, color='g')

# %%
(WMT['Daily Return'].dropna()).quantile(0.05)

# %% [markdown]
# The 0.05 empirical quantile of WMT stock daily returns is at -0.013. That means that with 95% confidence, our worst daily loss will not exceed 1.3%. If we have a 1 million dollar investment, our one-day 5% VaR is 0.013 * 1,000,000 = $13,000.

# For NKE stocks

# %%
(NKE['Daily Return'].dropna()).quantile(0.05)

# %% [markdown]
# The 0.05 empirical quantile of NKE stock daily returns is at -0.018. That means that with 95% confidence, our worst daily loss will not exceed 1.8%. If we have a 1 million dollar investment, our one-day 5% VaR is 0.018 * 1,000,000 = $18,000.
